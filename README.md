This is my entry into JavaScripting. I was able to create an interactive experience for a user. The user is able to input data into text boxes and make selections from radio dial button. By calling functions that use document.query.selector and el.inner.html, I am able to specify a selector criteria and the script changes the HTML to reflect the user inputted data. I hope that this is the beginning of coding and I hope to learn more.
